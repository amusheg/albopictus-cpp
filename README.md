# albopictus-cpp: Diapause incidence and critical photoperiod of Ae. albopictus populations across a range of latitudes in the US and Japan

This study recapitulates work done in Urbanski et al. Am Nat 2012: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/664709

```Albopictus_cpp_MS.Rmd``` contains code for calculating diapause incidence and critical photoperiod, collating climate data, analyzing correlations and generating figures.
