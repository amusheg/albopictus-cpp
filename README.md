# albopictus-cpp: Diapause incidence and critical photoperiod of Ae. albopictus populations across a range of latitudes in the US and Japan

This study recapitulates work done in Urbanski et al. Am Nat 2012: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/664709

CPP_experiment_data_collated.csv: All data from 2019 CPP study (from 2018 field collections)
CPP_2008.csv: diapause photoperiod response curves from 2008 study (Urbanski et al 2012 data)
CPP_1988.csv: CPP data from Pumpuni et al 1988

These three files are used as input in CPP_analysis.Rmd to compare CPP data across latitudes, countries and years. Diapause incidence data from this analysis was written to diapause_incidence_8h_2008_2018.csv.

mapping_pops_cpp_expt.csv contains information about collection sites. Together with diapause_incidence_8h_2008_2018.csv, it's input into maps.R to create maps.
